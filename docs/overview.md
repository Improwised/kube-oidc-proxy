##  Introduction

**Secure Kubernetes Access Management**

Kube-OIDC-Proxy is a powerful OIDC-based authentication and authorization proxy for Kubernetes clusters. It provides a secure, centralized way to manage access to multiple Kubernetes clusters through a single entry point, leveraging OpenID Connect (OIDC) for identity verification and role-based access control.

Built on the robust kube-oidc-proxy foundation, Kube-OIDC-Proxy/Apexkube enhances security by eliminating the need for direct API server access and static credentials, replacing them with dynamic token-based authentication through trusted identity providers like Keycloak.

Kube-OIDC-Proxy serves as a critical security layer between users and your Kubernetes infrastructure. It acts as a reverse proxy that intercepts all kubectl requests, authenticates users via OIDC, verifies their permissions based on predefined roles, and only then forwards authorized requests to the appropriate Kubernetes API server.

**Key Components:**

1. **Authentication Layer**: Verifies user identity through OIDC providers like Keycloak, Dex, etc.
2. **Authorization Engine**: Enforces fine-grained access controls based with roles and bindings on cluster and namespaces.
3. **Multi-Cluster Gateway**: Routes requests to the appropriate cluster based on URL path
4. **Audit System**: Provides logging and optional webhook integration for security monitoring

##  Benefits:

1. **Centralized Authentication**: Single sign-on across all clusters using your existing identity provider
2. **Enhanced Security**: No static credentials, token-based access with automatic expiration
3. **Simplified Administration**: Manage access policies in one place for all clusters
4. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing tools like kubectl without requiring special clients


## Features

1. **Multi-Cluster Support**: Manage access to multiple Kubernetes clusters through a single proxy instance, with dynamic cluster addition and removal.

2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Predefined and custom roles with fine-grained permissions.

3. **Namespace-Specific Access**: Restrict users to specific namespaces within clusters, perfect for multi-tenant environments.

4. **Dynamic Configuration**: Add or remove clusters, roles and bindings without restarting the proxy, ideal for evolving infrastructure.

5. **Comprehensive Auditing**: Logs of all access attempts with optional webhook integration for security monitoring systems.

6. **TLS Encryption**: Secure communication between clients, proxy, and API servers.

## Use Cases

**Enterprise Multi-Cluster Management**:
Kube-OIDC-Proxy enables large organizations to centralize access management across development, staging, and production clusters. IT teams can enforce consistent security policies while giving developers appropriate access to their environments.

**Secure Access**:
Teams can access only the resources they need in specific namespaces, with specific capabilities based on their role, without requiring direct cluster access.

**Compliance-Focused Environments**:
Organizations in regulated industries can implement Kube-OIDC-Proxy to ensure all cluster access is authenticated, authorized, and audited according to compliance requirements, with logs for security reviews.

**Hybrid/Multi-Cloud Deployments**:
Companies running Kubernetes across multiple cloud providers can use Kube-OIDC-Proxy as a unified access point, abstracting away the underlying infrastructure differences and providing consistent authentication.

**Temporary Access Provisioning**:

Security teams can grant temporary access to contractors or auditors by assigning time-limited roles through the identity provider, without changing cluster configurations or creating service accounts.
